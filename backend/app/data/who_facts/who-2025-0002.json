    "verdict": "misleading",
    "severity": "critical",
    "summary": "While curcumin (the active compound in turmeric) has shown some anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in laboratory studies, there is insufficient clinical evidence to support claims that turmeric can cure cancer or replace conventional cancer treatments like chemotherapy. Relying solely on turmeric instead of proven medical treatments can delay diagnosis and effective therapy, leading to poorer health outcomes. Cancer patients should consult qualified oncologists and follow evidence-based treatment protocols.",
